** Themes
I like to tweak emacs to the theme that I like. Here are some beautiful themes that I've tried (themes directory contains source code for some of them)
- [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme][Spacemacs theme]]
- [[https://github.com/emacsfodder/Emacs-theme-Darktooth][Darktooth theme]]
- [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][Doom theme]]
- [[https://github.com/cpaulik/emacs-material-theme][Material theme]]

In addition to above, [[https://emacsthemes.com/][here]] is a themes gallery for emacs which contains tons of themes.
